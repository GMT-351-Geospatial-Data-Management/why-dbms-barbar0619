Explain why we need a DataBase Management System (DBMS) instead of a spreadsheet?
The primary technological distinction between a spreadsheet and a database is how data is stored. Data is kept in a cell in a spreadsheet and can be formatted, altered, and modified within that cell. Cells in a database hold records from different tables.Databases store information more effectively, and they can handle large amounts of data that would be impossible to manage on a spreadsheet. Databases do not have record restrictions, however spreadsheets have. Spreadsheets, in comparison to databases, can take up a lot of hard disk space for data storage.

Advantages using a DBMS compared to a spreadsheet
• DMBS can be used by multiple users at the same time.
• Databases can be backed up security, centrally, and automatically
• Data is more secure with options to limit access by machine, user, networks, passwords.
• Spreadsheets are often difficult to code effectively

Disadvantages using a DBMS compared to a spreadsheet
• High Cost
• Size
• Database Failure
